Define:-This is simple login and Signup page with Backend-ExpressJS and MongoDB Atlas using online mongodb.

Objectives:-Develop a real-world Forums application, a common use case in web development
1. Create and manage three distinct collections: "User," "Post," and "Comments" to handle different data types.
2. Describe the relationship between posts and comments within the application's data structure
3. Map application functionality to specific routes and control logic using controllers
